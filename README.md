## Project Title : 
MoneyWise ~ Enabling Teenagers to Track Expenses Seamlessly using Azure Computer Vision

## Problem Statement : 

Teenagers often struggle to keep track of their expenses, leading to poor financial management and difficulty in budgeting. While various budgeting apps are available, they typically rely on manual entry of receipts, which is prone to errors and often forgotten, especially in situations where receipts are not readily available. This lack of accurate expense tracking hampers teenagers' ability to understand and manage their finances effectively. To develop a console application using C# and Mocrosoft Azure CV that leverages Azure Computer Vision to automatically extract expenses and the total amount from a photo of a receipt eliminating the need for manual receipt entry and addresses the issue of teenagers struggling to track their expenses accurately.

## Project Description :

The aim of the project is to develop a console application using C# and Visual Studio that leverages Azure Computer Vision to automatically extract expenses and the total amount from a photo of a receipt. This approach eliminates the need for manual receipt entry and addresses the issue of teenagers struggling to track their expenses accurately. By utilizing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology, specifically Microsoft Azure's Computer Vision service, the application will be able to extract relevant information from the receipt, overcoming the challenge of forgotten or unavailable receipts. The focus will be on accurate reading, and Azure Computer Vision has shown superior results compared to other OCR platforms.

## Primary Azure Technology : Azure Computer Vision.
This service provides Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities, allowing the application to extract text from images, specifically receipts in this case.
